                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    Okay, just got the first page up and running. 
                    Welcome, this is the start of my public journal detailing the steps I'm taking to find a job. 
                    This is primarily a way for me to hold myself accountable, as well as a way to display the thing's I'm achieving post-completion of my Bachelor's last Fall.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>The Roadmap</h2>

                    I'll improve this list as I get more solid dates and plans, and updating this site is another task for Phase 0, so if you're reading this, it's already begun. 
                    A less tangible goal is to contirubte to my GitHub every single day, and keeping this blog updated counts, so I'll be aiming for daily updates! Today I finished all of the basic blog setup, so the ball is already rolling.</p>
                <p>Fingers crossed!</p>
