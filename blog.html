                <h2>Resume Updates</h2>
                <p>
                    Made some resume modifications in preparation of my next application wave,
                    but I'd really like to redo the whole thing in a ".md" format after watching
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgV6M1LyfNY&t=522s">this video</a>. 
                    Probably a silly idea though, anything out of the norm is likely filtered 
                    out these days. Maybe just a master resume on my github? TBD

                <h2>Interview Prep</h2>
                <p>Brief reprieve from the DS+A curriculum, I've been getting a lot of attention this 
                    week from my applications, including a second round interview as a Curriculum Advisor
                    and a Hackerank test for a Database Engineering gig, so I'm focusing my energy there 
                    this week. My Coachable work shouldn't be affected, there're fewer topics in each 
                    subsequent week so taking notes is faster as I progress.

                <h2>Cleaning up my messy coursework</h2>
                <p>
                    My energy has had to go towards a lot of other avenues this week, and as a 
                    result my schooling was a bit splintered. I completed the most recent quiz 
                    for section 4, but I have yet to complete my review. I'd finished notes for
                    section 5, but I had yet to finish the PQs and Coding section. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    SO! Today I finished the coding challenge for section 5, focusing on traversing
                    Trees in different ways, getting largest smallest elements, and also some Trie
                    work. Once that was finished, I was able to knock out the remaining PQs for the
                    section. I started my notes on Section 6 (Graphs, adj matrices, adj lists) and aim
                    to finish the Quiz 4 review by EOD. Firmly planting myself in Section 6. Aiming 
                    to have the notes done by Monday, so I can start the next PQs and Coding Challenge.

                <p>
                    Hello November! Time keeps marching forward despite my protests, and we're now 1/3
                    of the way through my 30/60/90 plan. So it's time to check in. According to my checklist
                    43 daily updates ago, my main goals for phase 1 were: Improving my resume, finishing over half 
                    the Coachable Curriculum, and connecting with my Startup group. My resume has been landing me 
                    more interviews which is a good sign, but there's still work to be done here. I'm fully done with 
                    the first four of eight weeks of the curriculum, which is still on track but I'd rather be further. 
                    Hoping to finish up week 5 early to retain the gap. I'll also connect with my teammates today to
                    see if there's an updated plan.

                <p>
                    After lots of delays, I knocked out the Quiz for Weeks 3 and 4, most of the 
                    material centering around Sorts, String manipulation, and Recursion. I'm pleased with how I did,
                    not only due to the higher score but also because I finished with time to spare,
                    something I failed to do last quiz.

                    My qualifications lined up nicely from my work at Zenith and they seem to like me, so 
                    fingers crossed! I'll have more news in a week. Tomorrow night I actually have another 
                    interview with a different company so I'll be back with updates.

                    them at a quicker rate. BUT later today I'll be taking the next Quiz (3+4) so I'll 
                    officially be halfway done with Coachable DS+A! If there's time, I'd like to finish 
                    the notes on Week 5 so I can focus on the review questions over the weekend.

                    did manage to make some progress networking. The two big pushes I want to make in 
                    that regard is 1) Tailor my resume to individual intern positions and focus them,
                    and 2) Do some Computer Science-related volunteering, just today I found a job
                    posting for a Web Master Volunteer. Still a good option as long as nothing compromises
                    my curriculm progress. More to come as always.

                <p>
                    Bite-sized update, worked on this section's coding challenges in the library, with part 1 being various
                    string manipulation functions, like finding substrings and subsequences and their frequency, as well
                    as reversing strings without built-in functions. Pretty easy, good stringbuilder practice. Which as it 
                    turned out, was the next coding exercise: writing a stringbuilder class for Python, manipulating strings
                    as lists with delete, replace, append, capacity, etc.

                    I completed both fairly easily, but my time spent coding could still be improved. I want to set aside a day
                    of work or maybe the end of a day of work to marathon the coding exercises I've done so far, not memorizing
                    the code but memorizing the steps to take for each and further practicing python syntax. Embarrassingly I still
                    have to look up basics like list manipulation. But that's exactly what this pratice is for! Hopefully more section 5 notes tomorrow.

                    tonight. As a way to keep ahead (and to give myself variety), I started the 
                    notes for Section 5 early: Binary Trees and Tries. I'm looking forward to the 
                    material here because although I'm comfortable with the theory of BTs I don't have
                    as much experience with the code around them as I would like.

                    After my Mario reprieve, I'm jumping back in with Coachable Week 4, starting with
                    a review of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEFsJ-43pnA">Anagrams</a> before
                    moving on to something (a little) meatier, everyone's favorite Sorts: Insertion, 
                    Selection (yawn), Merge (my beloved), and Quick. Easy to knock out, and should be 
                    on Schedule to finish the notes for this
                    week tomorrow before starting the practice questions.

                    and started my notes for week 4. I've read through the section on Strings and Palindromes, Anagrams is
                    up next. Most of this is still review from the DSA class I took for my B.S., but it's helpful to have a 
                    daily review of Python to really burrow it into my brain.

                    Finished taking notes for this week's curriculum, with material spanning Hash Maps, Deques, LRU Queues,
                    Recursion, Binary Searches, and Recurrence Relationships. Tomorrow I'll start on the end-of-chapter

                <p>
                    Didn't make as much progress today as I would've liked, but I did start working on a 
                    new section of Coachable work. I've been adapting the videos I've watched of programmers 
                    doing live-code interviews into a series of steps to take. <br>
                    <br>
                    Essentially:<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Discuss with the interviewer the expected behavior in various scenarios, noting them down</li>
                        <li>Determine the data structure(s) for the tast</li>
                        <li>Begin Coding helper classes, then functions, then the main class</li>
                        <li>Once ready, turn the noted examples from step 1 into test cases, and iterate through edge cases</li>
                        <li>Discuss runtime, memory, any weaknesses in the code due to assumptions and possible fixes</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    It's a light list but it gives me a good roadmap to follow while I'm under pressure in a timed or live scenario

                    Micro update today, just making my way through the curriculum. Part of the lessons involve 
                    video capture of the CEO taking live interview questions, and it's helping me build up a 
                    flowchart for how to approach live coding challenges. Today I was coding along to him building
                    a LRU from scratch, and the process of building examples, determining the best data structure,
                    and coding/debugging was highly informative, I'd like to write out a few full guide later.
                    Library tomorrow to knock out this week's notes and start on the Practice Questions!

                    Quick update, passed my quiz! It consisted of several multiple choice questions about everything from runtime analysis 
                    to bject oriented specifics, and then three coding challenges involving linkedlists, more object oriented stuff, and
                    dictionaries. I ran out of time getting hung up on silly things during the coding challenge, but I reviewed all my missed 
                    questions and sent them over to my mentors for review.

                    include the practice questions and coding challenges is up to my speed.

                    the Week 2 Quiz, so I plan on attempting that soon, and I plan on finishing another section 
                    in the Week 3 curriculum to stay ahead. Currently reviewing Hash Maps (which I used as part

                    An unfortunate update, but I worked for hours yesterday and wasn't able to finish the TSP 
                    assignment. Very frustrating, but I've saved what worked, I've reviewed Coachable's guide on solving
                    coding problems (link) and I'm feeling ready to jump back into things today.

                    Done! Upon review, the few things that were holding me back yesterday were all related to traversing a LinkedList
                    properly. I was trying to use 'While curr is not None' but kept running into issues when I hit the end of the List
                    and started querying for things that didn't exist. So I swapped for a For Loop and kept track of the index and size,
                    letting me known exactly when I was on the last element, and dictate proper behavior for that edge case.

                    There's always stuff to do of course. After I finish this post, I'll set up a pre-quiz review with my mentors and 
                    maybe even get a leg up by moving ahead into Week 3. I also have been meaning to build a Chrome Plugin that 
                    automates the ChatGPT-based application experience that Bethany Ren has been posting about in her newsletters. The
                    goal would be to show her what I've built as see if they're hiring interns still. BRB.

                    Heading home! Still waiting on a meeting time, but I managed to make some progress into Week 3, with notes on
                    Hashmaps, Deques, and Doubly Linked Lists. This section has more going on than the first two weeks, so it may
                    end up requiring more hours. Right now I'm trying to commit a minimum of 25 hours per week to Coachable, this week
                    I'll know if that's enough. Still glad I got my code to work though! There's nothing quite like that "All tests passed"

                    Starting my second week of my 30-60-90 plan, still ahead of schedule but not as far as I would like.
                    Late start at the library, but catching up. Just finished yesterday's recap post, and now I'm 
                    jumping into finishing the TSP Solution for Coachable. I'll check in once I'm finished!

                <h2>First missed daily update in two weeks</h2>
                <p>
                    Making this update on Monday from the library, I'd been attempting to keep a solid green wall 
                    on Github but last night neglected to summarize my day. No big deal, part of this project is 
                    to gather facts and sort them into data, and having perfect results would give boring data.
                    So if I missed a day over two weeks, that just gives me a bar for the next two. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Anyway, although I missed a blog post I still worked on my material, working through my final
                    Week 2 task: coding a solution to a Traveling Salesperson Probelm. This is actually the second
                    time I've dealt with such an algortihm, the first being my final for the DS&A Class @ WGU (link 
                    code here), but the practice is helpful. Today I built all the functions for the supporting classes, 
                    tomorrow I'l finish things up and maybe even start on Week 3?

                    <br>
                    The last two sections are on LinkedLists and Queues so I should be done by tomorrow unless I keep

                    but I previously heard that I should meet after the assessment, so I'll reach out and clear that 
                    up to schedule a meeting and move on to Week 3! Trying to increase my pace so I'm further than

                <p>
                    Today I made some progress into Coachable Week 2, hoping to knock it out before the weekend,
                    but I also spent some time on LinkedIn. I came accross a post about the Matthew Isakowitz 
                    Fellowship, an "internship, mentorship, and networking opportunity awarded to students pursuing
                    careers in the commerical spaceflight industry". Needless to say I was intrigued. After some 
                    research, it turns out there are a handful of these fellowships all signing up this season.

                    Unfortunately, the deadline is Oct. 7th (this Saturday) which wouldn't normally be a problem, 
                    except that's pretty short notice to acquire some letters of recomendation. So I'm going to 
                    keep researching and maybe prep for next year's fellowships? If I haven't landed an aerospace
                    job yet

                <p>
                    Just passed the first assessment. The test focused on Python Fundamentals and Object-Oriented design    
                    principles, and was pretty easy. The topics included:<br>
                        ‚Ä¢ Fizz Buzz (modulo, strip())<br>
                        ‚Ä¢ Lists (traversal, max)<br>
                        ‚Ä¢ Dictionaries / Tuples (sorting by keys, values)<br>
                        ‚Ä¢ OOD (inheritance, instance/class methods)<br>
                    I'll link the code and the challenge <a href="http://github.com">here</a> once I've uploaded it
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With the basics out of the way, Week 2 looks to be based around math concepts for programmers,
                    including things like Binary, with the second half dealing with Runtime/Space Complexity before 
                    finishing with Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues. I'll check in after I've made some progress.

                <h2>5:00pm - Halfway through Week 2</h2>
                <p>
                    This section is way more manageable notes-wise than the previous section, and it helps that 
                    I still have a pretty good grasp of basic math. The differences between Constant, Log, Linear,
                    Exponential, Quadratic, etc. are all intuitive, so I'm breezing through this section. Hope to
                    finish up tomorrow and start on the review, maybe even getting to the assessment
                </p>

                    Quick update for today, I finished Coachable Curriculum Week 1 Review, all
                    that's left is the coding assessment which I plan on taking first thing tomorrow morning.
                    <br><br>
                    The plan at the moment is to divide my 8 hour chunks of library time into primarily Coachable
                    work so I'm always progressing, and then splitting the remaining time into applying to new
                    roles/networking, with the final chunk of time devoted to reaching out to prior connections 
                    again and touching base.

                    As I mentioned in yesterday's update, today I competed in a Bouldering Competition.
                    It was challenging but a lot of fun, there were 40 routes total, the higher the number 
                    the higher the difficulty, scoring the top 5 climbs completed. I did 28 through 32, 
                    which is a little dissappointing but give me some new data to train on. I'll have the 
                    full results on Monday.
                </p>

                <h2>Back to Business</h2>
                <p>
                    In career news, tomorrow is the first day of October! So I'll be committing to 
                    my 30-60-90 plan until my efforts bear fruit. I recently read a good 
                    <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/10/why-you-should-build-a-career-portfolio-not-a-career-path">
                        article by April Rinne</a> 
                    about the difference between a Career Portfolio and a Career Path (essentially building a net
                    that shows how all your skills and passions relate and reinforce each other) and it really resonated 
                    with me; I've always tried to gain lessons from every role I have in life, and presenting them 
                    all together as my "story" feels intuitive. Tomorrow I'll be prepping for the week, and one 
                    of those prep tasks will be mapping my career portfolio to see what areas I can build upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other items to take care of tomorrow:
                        ‚Ä¢ Wrkable.ai was just founded by one of my mentors at Coachable, they're hiring S.E. Interns so I'll be applying
                        ‚Ä¢ Rivian has a listing for Summer 2024 internships
                        ‚Ä¢ VAST has an opening for Spring
                        ‚Ä¢ Spinlaunch is hiring an IT Associate
                        ‚Ä¢ Relativity Spcae is looking for an IT associate
                    Judging by my to-do list, most of tomorrow will be spent fine-tuning my resum√© before applying, 
                    as well as reaching out and networking with the posters (Wrkable Founder Bethany Ren in particular!)

                <p>
                    I've primarily been writing about my career work here, but I made this blog so 
                    I can change the rules, and today I'm writing about my other passion: Rock Climbing!
                    The past few days my attention has been split while I train for The Murrtown Showdown, 
                    a rock climbing competition @ VITAL Gym in Murrieta. I've competed in a few other 
                    competitions before, but the highest I've ever placed is 9th, and I'm aiming to beat that 
                    this time

                <h2>Library</h2>
                <p>
                    Since my workload grows everyday, I've been running into challenges trying to stay organized
                    in my studio apartment, so I decided to look into an official working space. After realizing 
                    that offices are expensive, I decided to check out my local library. Here I can comfortably
                    rent a room and have a secluded option to knock out my work.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This has done wonders for my productivity, and I'm just about finished with my Coachable notes,
                    ready for a full review / check in. Tomorrow I want to come back for a full workday, and put
                    8 hours towards my career every weekday until my efforts bear fruit.

                <h2>Time Management and Academic Application</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been pretty lenient with my daily scheduling so far, but once I've got a chunk 
                    of work lined up for October, I'm going to need to be more disciplined. I decided to    
                    be more methodical in my work, and better apply the skills I've learned from WGU, FSAE,
                    and Coachable. I reviewed my coursework from <a>C188-Software Engineering</a> and 
                    decided to implement AGILE-style project management into my daily routine. In order
                    to keep track of tasks, I created an account for the task management software that  
                    Formula Slug used for FSAE: Trello, and added several of the tasks that I've outlined
                    in this blog. With this productivity stack (along with Slack for Coachable communication),
                    I aim to break my work into prioritized sprints, getting a lot done in short bursts of
                    productivity, before reviewing and repeating the process.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I feel really good about setting all this up, and it works more as a true application of 
                    all the techniques I've learned through intra and extracurricular studies. I'm excited to 
                    make some solid progess.

                <p>
                    I took a HackerRank test to practice my REST API skills, and was able to
                    pretty easily knock out a problem connecting to a server and parsing some JSON.
                    But the Second question was more technical, involving batching like requests together
                    and determinging minimal processing time. I intend to spend more time on it, maybe 
                    even writing a breakdown here to ensure I understand it fully.

                    up some meetings with the contacts I reached out to earlier in the week. Crucially,
                    I'll be meeting with my Coachable mentor to discuss my progress. 5 days left to 
                    build up max momentum!

                    that can be shared, but of my own personal clips. Eventually could be built
                    into more of a social network-style pool of your friends clips too, similar 
                    to the Discord experience. Would be a fun way to learn

                <p>
                    Today I was busy so I didn't get as much done as I would've liked, 
                    but I was able to make some plans for the rest of this week/next:
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Blog Features Incoming</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>I want to add separate pages for each post, and that includes 
                    designing a way to navigate through them. Ideally, I'll transition 
                    to using a single file for all blog posts, with the appropriate data saturating 
                    the single blog.html page when the user loads it. I'm sure this can be 
                    done with JavaScript/jQuery or maybe even natively in Github, I'll do
                    more research tomorrow. 
                    <br><br>
                    Also need to look into auto-updating the "last updated" 
                    tag in my footer since I keep forgetting to timestamp it on commit.

                <p>
                    <br>I also took up some advice I received and started compiling a 
                    list (technically a Google Sheet which I'll link here) of all the companies
                    I'd like to work for. Essentially a collection of various Aerospace, EV,
                    and Tech companies that have internships approaching. The sheet will also 
                    serve as a way to track applications once they start opening up in October.<br>

                    With the color coding, it's becomes easier to see how the next few months
                    will go, with a heavier emphasis on projects and volunteering before hiring season
                    begins, then transitioning into heavy career work right before next year.

                    As for my academic progress, I've started Coacheable work and should be able 
                    to finish all the material in Week 1 by today, ready 
                    to review ahead of schedule.
                    <br><br>
                    That's all till tomorrow!

                    Okay, just got the first page up and running. 
                    Welcome, this is the start of my public journal detailing the steps I'm taking to find a job. 
                    This is primarily a way for me to hold myself accountable, as well as a way to display the things I'm achieving post-completion of my Bachelor's last Fall.

                    I'll improve this list as I get more solid dates and plans, and updating this site is another task for Phase 0, so if you're reading this, it's already begun. 
                    A less tangible goal is to contirubte to my GitHub every single day, and keeping this blog updated counts, so I'll be aiming for daily updates! Today I finished all of the basic blog setup, so the ball is already rolling.</p>
                <p>Fingers crossed!</p>
