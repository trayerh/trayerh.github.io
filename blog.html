                <h2>12 Days Until October</h2>
                <p>
                    Leading up to October, I'm going to be focusing on 
                    connecting with people and companies to line up some
                    work for the month. Sending out emails to M4 Engineering
                    in Long Beach and Killstress in Los Alamitos to see 
                    if they need any volunteers.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm also updating this site to have some color coordinations, 
                    with posts highlighted for being about a 
                    <span class="red-text">personal project</span>,
                    <span class="blue-text">career work</span>, or 
                    <span class="yellow-text">volunteering</span>. 
                    With the color coding, it's becomes easier to see how the next few months
                    will go, with a heavier emphasis on projects and volunteering before hiring season
                    begins, then transitioning into heavy career work right before next year.
                    <br><br>
                    As for my academic progress, I've started Coacheable work and should be able 
                    to finish all the material in Week 1 by today, ready 
                    to review ahead of schedule.
                    <br><br>
                    That's all till tomorrow!

                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    Okay, just got the first page up and running. 
                    Welcome, this is the start of my public journal detailing the steps I'm taking to find a job. 
                    This is primarily a way for me to hold myself accountable, as well as a way to display the things I'm achieving post-completion of my Bachelor's last Fall.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>The Roadmap</h2>

                <p>
                    I'll improve this list as I get more solid dates and plans, and updating this site is another task for Phase 0, so if you're reading this, it's already begun. 
                    A less tangible goal is to contirubte to my GitHub every single day, and keeping this blog updated counts, so I'll be aiming for daily updates! Today I finished all of the basic blog setup, so the ball is already rolling.</p>
                <p>Fingers crossed!</p>
