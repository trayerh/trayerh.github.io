                    Quick update for today, I finished Coachable Curriculum Week 1 Review, all
                    that's left is the coding assessment which I plan on taking first thing tomorrow morning.
                    <br>
                    The plan at the moment is to divide my 8 hour chunks of library time into primarily Coachable
                    work so I'm always progressing, and then splitting the remaining time into applying to new
                    roles/networking, with the final chunk of time devoted to reaching out to prior connections 
                    again and touching base.

                <h2>Competition Woes</h2>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned in yesterday's update, today I competed in a Bouldering Competition.
                    It was challenging but a lot of fun, there were 40 routes total, the higher the number 
                    the higher the difficulty, scoring the top 5 climbs completed. I did 28 through 32, 
                    which is a little dissappointing but give me some new data to train on. I'll have the 
                    full results on Monday.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Back to Business</h2>
                <p>
                    In career news, tomorrow is the first day of October! So I'll be committing to 
                    my 30-60-90 plan until my efforts bear fruit. I recently read a good 
                    <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/10/why-you-should-build-a-career-portfolio-not-a-career-path">
                        article by April Rinne</a> 
                    about the difference between a Career Portfolio and a Career Path (essentially building a net
                    that shows how all your skills and passions relate and reinforce each other) and it really resonated 
                    with me; I've always tried to gain lessons from every role I have in life, and presenting them 
                    all together as my "story" feels intuitive. Tomorrow I'll be prepping for the week, and one 
                    of those prep tasks will be mapping my career portfolio to see what areas I can build upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other items to take care of tomorrow:
                        â€¢ Wrkable.ai was just founded by one of my mentors at Coachable, they're hiring S.E. Interns so I'll be applying
                        â€¢ Rivian has a listing for Summer 2024 internships
                        â€¢ VAST has an opening for Spring
                        â€¢ Spinlaunch is hiring an IT Associate
                        â€¢ Relativity Spcae is looking for an IT associate
                    Judging by my to-do list, most of tomorrow will be spent fine-tuning my resumÃ© before applying, 
                    as well as reaching out and networking with the posters (Wrkable Founder Bethany Ren in particular!)

                <p>That's my micro life update, maybe I'll do more mixed-topic updates in the future to keep things interesting. 
                    For me, of course. No one else reads these. Logging off now, but remember,</p>

                <p>
                    I've primarily been writing about my career work here, but I made this blog so 
                    I can change the rules, and today I'm writing about my other passion: Rock Climbing!
                    The past few days my attention has been split while I train for The Murrtown Showdown, 
                    a rock climbing competition @ VITAL Gym in Murrieta. I've competed in a few other 
                    competitions before, but the highest I've ever placed is 9th, and I'm aiming to beat that 
                    this time

                <h2>Library</h2>
                <p>
                    Since my workload grows everyday, I've been running into challenges trying to stay organized
                    in my studio apartment, so I decided to look into an official working space. After realizing 
                    that offices are expensive, I decided to check out my local library. Here I can comfortably
                    rent a room and have a secluded option to knock out my work.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This has done wonders for my productivity, and I'm just about finished with my Coachable notes,
                    ready for a full review / check in. Tomorrow I want to come back for a full workday, and put
                    8 hours towards my career every weekday until my efforts bear fruit.

                <h2>Time Management and Academic Application</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been pretty lenient with my daily scheduling so far, but once I've got a chunk 
                    of work lined up for October, I'm going to need to be more disciplined. I decided to    
                    be more methodical in my work, and better apply the skills I've learned from WGU, FSAE,
                    and Coachable. I reviewed my coursework from <a>C188-Software Engineering</a> and 
                    decided to implement AGILE-style project management into my daily routine. In order
                    to keep track of tasks, I created an account for the task management software that  
                    Formula Slug used for FSAE: Trello, and added several of the tasks that I've outlined
                    in this blog. With this productivity stack (along with Slack for Coachable communication),
                    I aim to break my work into prioritized sprints, getting a lot done in short bursts of
                    productivity, before reviewing and repeating the process.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I feel really good about setting all this up, and it works more as a true application of 
                    all the techniques I've learned through intra and extracurricular studies. I'm excited to 
                    make some solid progess.

                <h2>HackerRank Practice</h2>
                <p>
                    I took a HackerRank test to practice my REST API skills, and was able to
                    pretty easily knock out a problem connecting to a server and parsing some JSON.
                    But the Second question was more technical, involving batching like requests together
                    and determinging minimal processing time. I intend to spend more time on it, maybe 
                    even writing a breakdown here to ensure I understand it fully.

                    There's an increasingly limited time to get everything lined up before starting
                    my 30-60-90 plan, so I'll be putting the finishing touches on my resume and setting
                    up some meetings with the contacts I reached out to earlier in the week. Crucially,
                    I'll be meeting with my Coachable mentor to discuss my progress. 5 days left to 
                    build up max momentum!

                    Small update, mainly have been reviewing Coacheable material and taking notes,

                    <br>I also had a quick idea that I'd like to document to flesh out later, 
                    essetially a feed where I can post cuts of audio, video, for gifs or clips 
                    that can be shared, but of my own personal clips. Eventually could be built
                    into more of a social network-style pool of your friends clips too, similar 
                    to the Discord experience. Would be a fun way to learn
                    more about back-end media processing.

                <h2>Light Day</h2>
                <p>
                    Today I was busy so I didn't get as much done as I would've liked, 
                    but I was able to make some plans for the rest of this week/next:
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Blog Features Incoming</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>I want to add separate pages for each post, and that includes 
                    designing a way to navigate through them. Ideally, I'll transition 
                    to using a single file for all blog posts, with the appropriate data saturating 
                    the single blog.html page when the user loads it. I'm sure this can be 
                    done with JavaScript/jQuery or maybe even natively in Github, I'll do
                    more research tomorrow. 
                    <br><br>
                    Also need to look into auto-updating the "last updated" 
                    tag in my footer since I keep forgetting to timestamp it on commit.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                    <h3>The Hit List</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>I also took up some advice I received and started compiling a 
                    list (technically a Google Sheet which I'll link here) of all the companies
                    I'd like to work for. Essentially a collection of various Aerospace, EV,
                    and Tech companies that have internships approaching. The sheet will also 
                    serve as a way to track applications once they start opening up in October.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Today was a <s>shorter</s> <b>concise</b> update, but there's more on the way!
                    <br>

                </p>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h1 class="blog-post-title">1 - Emails and Colorcoding</h1>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Sept. 19 2023</p>
                <br>

                <h2>12 Days Until October</h2>
                <p>
                    Leading up to October, I'm going to be focusing on 
                    connecting with people and companies to line up some
                    work for the month. Sending out emails to M4 Engineering
                    in Long Beach and Killstress in Los Alamitos to see 
                    if they need any volunteers.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm also updating this site to have some color coordinations, 
                    with posts highlighted for being about a 
                    <span class="red-text">personal project</span>,
                    <span class="blue-text">career work</span>, or 
                    <span class="yellow-text">volunteering</span>. 
                    With the color coding, it's becomes easier to see how the next few months
                    will go, with a heavier emphasis on projects and volunteering before hiring season
                    begins, then transitioning into heavy career work right before next year.
                    <br><br>
                    As for my academic progress, I've started Coacheable work and should be able 
                    to finish all the material in Week 1 by today, ready 
                    to review ahead of schedule.
                    <br><br>
                    That's all till tomorrow!

                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    Okay, just got the first page up and running. 
                    Welcome, this is the start of my public journal detailing the steps I'm taking to find a job. 
                    This is primarily a way for me to hold myself accountable, as well as a way to display the things I'm achieving post-completion of my Bachelor's last Fall.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>The Roadmap</h2>

                <p>
                    I'll improve this list as I get more solid dates and plans, and updating this site is another task for Phase 0, so if you're reading this, it's already begun. 
                    A less tangible goal is to contirubte to my GitHub every single day, and keeping this blog updated counts, so I'll be aiming for daily updates! Today I finished all of the basic blog setup, so the ball is already rolling.</p>
                <p>Fingers crossed!</p>
