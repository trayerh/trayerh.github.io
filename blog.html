                <h2>Time Management and Academic Application</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been pretty lenient with my daily scheduling so far, but once I've got a chunk 
                    of work lined up for October, I'm going to need to be more disciplined. I decided to    
                    be more methodical in my work, and better apply the skills I've learned from WGU, FSAE,
                    and Coachable. I reviewed my coursework from <a>C188-Software Engineering</a> and 
                    decided to implement AGILE-style project management into my daily routine. In order
                    to keep track of tasks, I created an account for the task management software that  
                    Formula Slug used for FSAE: Trello, and added several of the tasks that I've outlined
                    in this blog. With this productivity stack (along with Slack for Coachable communication),
                    I aim to break my work into prioritized sprints, getting a lot done in short bursts of
                    productivity, before reviewing and repeating the process.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I feel really good about setting all this up, and it works more as a true application of 
                    all the techniques I've learned through intra and extracurricular studies. I'm excited to 
                    make some solid progess.
                </p>

                    Quick idea that needs to be implemented, tags for each post that can be used to filter

                <h2>HackerRank Practice</h2>
                <p>
                    I took a HackerRank test to practice my REST API skills, and was able to
                    pretty easily knock out a problem connecting to a server and parsing some JSON.
                    But the Second question was more technical, involving batching like requests together
                    and determinging minimal processing time. I intend to spend more time on it, maybe 
                    even writing a breakdown here to ensure I understand it fully.

                <h2>Prep for Tomorrow</h2>
                <p>
                    There's an increasingly limited time to get everything lined up before starting
                    my 30-60-90 plan, so I'll be putting the finishing touches on my resume and setting
                    up some meetings with the contacts I reached out to earlier in the week. Crucially,
                    I'll be meeting with my Coachable mentor to discuss my progress. 5 days left to 
                    build up max momentum!

                    Small update, mainly have been reviewing Coacheable material and taking notes, 
                    thinking about a way to clean them up and post them here, definitely something
                    to look into.

                <p>
                    <br>I also had a quick idea that I'd like to document to flesh out later, 
                    essetially a feed where I can post cuts of audio, video, for gifs or clips 
                    that can be shared, but of my own personal clips. Eventually could be built
                    into more of a social network-style pool of your friends clips too, similar 
                    to the Discord experience. Would be a fun way to learn
                    more about back-end media processing.

                <h2>Light Day</h2>
                <p>
                    Today I was busy so I didn't get as much done as I would've liked, 
                    but I was able to make some plans for the rest of this week/next:
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Blog Features Incoming</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>I want to add separate pages for each post, and that includes 
                    designing a way to navigate through them. Ideally, I'll transition 
                    to using a single file for all blog posts, with the appropriate data saturating 
                    the single blog.html page when the user loads it. I'm sure this can be 
                    done with JavaScript/jQuery or maybe even natively in Github, I'll do
                    more research tomorrow. 
                    <br><br>
                    Also need to look into auto-updating the "last updated" 
                    tag in my footer since I keep forgetting to timestamp it on commit.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                    <h3>The Hit List</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>I also took up some advice I received and started compiling a 
                    list (technically a Google Sheet which I'll link here) of all the companies
                    I'd like to work for. Essentially a collection of various Aerospace, EV,
                    and Tech companies that have internships approaching. The sheet will also 
                    serve as a way to track applications once they start opening up in October.<br>
                </p>

                    <br>
                    Today was a <s>shorter</s> <b>concise</b> update, but there's more on the way!

                <br>

                <h2>12 Days Until October</h2>
                <p>
                    Leading up to October, I'm going to be focusing on 
                    connecting with people and companies to line up some
                    work for the month. Sending out emails to M4 Engineering
                    in Long Beach and Killstress in Los Alamitos to see 
                    if they need any volunteers.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm also updating this site to have some color coordinations, 
                    with posts highlighted for being about a 
                    <span class="red-text">personal project</span>,
                    <span class="blue-text">career work</span>, or 
                    <span class="yellow-text">volunteering</span>. 
                    With the color coding, it's becomes easier to see how the next few months
                    will go, with a heavier emphasis on projects and volunteering before hiring season
                    begins, then transitioning into heavy career work right before next year.
                    <br><br>
                    As for my academic progress, I've started Coacheable work and should be able 
                    to finish all the material in Week 1 by today, ready 
                    to review ahead of schedule.
                    <br><br>
                    That's all till tomorrow!

                    Welcome, this is the start of my public journal detailing the steps I'm taking to find a job. 
                    This is primarily a way for me to hold myself accountable, as well as a way to display the things I'm achieving post-completion of my Bachelor's last Fall.

                    I'll improve this list as I get more solid dates and plans, and updating this site is another task for Phase 0, so if you're reading this, it's already begun. 
                    A less tangible goal is to contirubte to my GitHub every single day, and keeping this blog updated counts, so I'll be aiming for daily updates! Today I finished all of the basic blog setup, so the ball is already rolling.</p>
                <p>Fingers crossed!</p>
